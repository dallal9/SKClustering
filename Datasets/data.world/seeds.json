{"name":"databeats_seeds","title":"Seeds","description":"Measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat.\n\nThis dataset and summary taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds)\n\nDataset Information:\n\nThe examined group comprised kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa and Canadian, 70 elements each, randomly selected for \nthe experiment. High quality visualization of the internal kernel structure was detected using a soft X-ray technique. It is non-destructive and considerably cheaper than other more sophisticated imaging techniques like scanning microscopy or laser technology. The images were recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. Studies were conducted using combine harvested wheat grain originating from experimental fields, explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin. \n\nThe dataset can be used for the tasks of classification and cluster analysis.\n\n\nAttribute Information:\n\nTo construct the data, seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels were measured: \n1. area A, \n2. perimeter P, \n3. compactness C = 4*pi*A/P^2, \n4. length of kernel, \n5. width of kernel, \n6. asymmetry coefficient \n7. length of kernel groove. \nAll of these parameters were real-valued continuous.\n\n\nRelevant Papers:\n\nM.
